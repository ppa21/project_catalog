## AI Policy Attribution

In adherence to the AI policy, this section outlines how AI tools were utilized during the development of this project.

My primary technical background is in Java/SpringBoot. To efficiently bridge my knowledge to the Python/Django stack for this assignment, I used an AI assistant in the following capacities:

*   **As a Syntax and Idiom Reference:** To quickly look up the Django-equivalent way of performing tasks I am familiar with in other frameworks (e.g., "How to create a many-to-many relationship in Django models"). This was more efficient than searching through documentation for specific syntax.
*   **As a Sounding Board:** After writing a piece of code, I would sometimes ask the AI to review it or confirm if my approach was a valid way to solve the problem in Django. This helped validate my logic and accelerate my learning.
*   **For Debugging Assistance:** To help identify potential errors or suggest troubleshooting steps for issues I encountered.

Crucially, **the core logic, project structure, and final implementation are my own.** AI was a supplementary tool for learning and validation, not for generating the solution. I have a full and complete understanding of all the code submitted and am prepared to discuss it in detail.
